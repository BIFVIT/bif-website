### For Developers:

1. Clone this project into your system by running the following:

Ensure that you have git & node installed on your systems (and added them to the environment PATH variables on your PC) if the above steps don't work.

- [Node Download](https://nodejs.org/en)

2. Run the project
   
```
    npm run dev
```

Then headover to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it live.

3. Quick Commands (Optional)

If you have tools to run Makefile installed ([Download Here](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) if not installed), I have added a Makefile to make it easier to use certain repetitive commands by adding a Makefile in the root of the project.

For example: You can use `make gt` to push to the repo instead of having to type `git add .` `git commit -m "Commit message"` and `git push origin main` everytime you want to push something.
